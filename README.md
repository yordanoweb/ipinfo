# ipinfo

Simple IP information based on nmcli using Rofi to display data

## Setup

* Install rofi package in whatever Linux distro you use

* Copy the .desktop file to your ~/.local/share/applications/ directory

* Modify the line "Exec=..." of your .desktop file pointing to the path where you put the launch.sh

After the "Setup" step, every time you list available applications via rofi or desktop environment menu, you will see a new icon named "Network Information". That's it.
