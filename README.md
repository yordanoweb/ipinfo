# ipinfo

Simple IP information based on nmcli using Rofi to display data

## Setup

* Install rofi package in whatever Linux distro you use

* Copy the .desktop file to your ~/.local/share/applications/ directory

After the "Setup" step, every time you list available applications via rofi or desktop environment menu, you will see a new icon named "Network Information". That's it.
